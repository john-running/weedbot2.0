# weedbot2.0

This repository contains files required to make weedbot drive along a prescribed path, capturing images of
whatever it is driving on, classifying those images and storing them in a SQLlite database. 

It also contains files to run a local Flask-based Webserver on weedbot so that the results can be viewed in a
web browser.
